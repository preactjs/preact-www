# Progressive Web Apps

## Overview

Preact is an excellent choice for [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) that wish to load and become interactive quickly.  [Preact CLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/) codifies this into an instant build tool that gives you a PWA with a 100 [Lighthouse][LH] score right out of the box.

          <p class="_summary">Preact's [small size](/about/project-goals) is valuable when you have a tight loading performance budget. On average mobile hardware, loading large bundles of JS leads to longer load, parse and eval times. This can leave users waiting a long time before they can interact with your app.  By trimming down the library code in your bundles, you load quicker by shipping less code to your users. </p>

## This site is a PWA

In fact, the site you're on right now is a Progressive Web App!. Here it is getting interactive in under 5 seconds in a trace from a Nexus 5X over 3G:

Static site content is stored in the (Service Worker) Cache Storage API enabling instant loading on repeat visits.

## Performance tips

While Preact is a drop-in that should work well for your PWA, it can also be used with a number of other tools and techniques. These include:

        <div class="list-header">

## Preact CLI

[Preact CLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/) is the official build tool for Preact projects. It's a single dependency command line tool that bundles your Preact code into a highly optimized Progressive Web App.  It aims to make all of the above recommendations automatic, so you can focus on writing great Components.

Here are a few things Preact CLI bakes in:

- Automatic, seamless code-splitting for your URL routes
- Automatically generates and installs a ServiceWorker
- Generates HTTP2/Push headers (or preload meta tags) based on the URL
- Pre-rendering for a fast Time To First Paint
- Conditionally loads polyfills if needed

Since [Preact CLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/) is internally powered by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), you can define a `preact.config.js` and customize the build process to suit your needs.  Even if you customize things, you still get to take advantage of awesome defaults, and can update as new versions of `preact-cli` are released.
