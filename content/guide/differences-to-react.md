# Differences to React

Preact itself is not intended to be a reimplementation of React.  There are differences.  Many of these differences are trivial, or can be completely removed by using [preact-compat], which is an thin layer over Preact that attempts to achieve 100% compatibility with React.

The reason Preact does not attempt to include every single feature of React is in order to remain **small** and **focused** - otherwise it would make more sense to simply submit optimizations to the React project, which is already a very complex and well-architected codebase.


## Version Compatibility

For both Preact and [preact-compat], version compatibility is measured against the _current_ and _previous_ major releases of React. When new features are announced by the React team, they may be added to Preact's core if it makes sense given the [Project Goals].  This is a fairly democratic process, constantly evolving through discussion and decisions made in the open, using issues and pull requests.

> Thus, the website and documentation reflect React `0.14.x` and `15.x` when discussing compatibility or making comparisons.


## What's Included?

- [ES6 Class Components]
    - _classes provide an expressive way to define stateful components_
- [High-Order Components]  
    - _components that return other components from `render()`, effectively wrappers_
- [Stateless Pure Functional Components]  
    - _functions that receive `props` as arguments and return JSX/VDOM_
- [Contexts]: Support for `context` was added in Preact [3.0].
    - _Context is an experimental React feature, but has been adopted by some libraries._
- [Refs]: Support for function refs was added in Preact in [4.0]. String refs are supported in `preact-compat`.
    - _Refs provide a way to refer to rendered elements and child components._
- Virtual DOM Diffing
    - _This is a given - Preact's diff is simple but effective, and **[extremely](http://developit.github.io/js-repaint-perfs/) [fast](https://localvoid.github.io/uibench/)**._
- `h()`, a more generalized version of `React.createElement`
    - _This idea was originally called [hyperscript] and has value well beyond the React ecosystem, so Preact promotes the original standard. ([Read: why `h()`?](http://jasonformat.com/wtf-is-jsx))_
    - _It's also a little more readable: `h('a', { href:'/' }, h('span', null, 'Home'))`_


## What's Added?

Preact actually adds a few convenient features inspired by work in the React community:

- `this.props` and `this.state` are passed to `render()` for you  
    - _You can still reference them manually. This is just cleaner, particularly when [destructuring]_
- [Linked State] updates state when inputs change automatically
- Batching of DOM updates, debounced/collated using `setTimeout(1)` _(can also use requestAnimationFrame)_
- You can just use `class` for CSS classes. `className` is still supported, but `class` is preferred.
- Component and element recycling/pooling.


## What's Missing?

- [PropType] Validation: Not everyone uses PropTypes, so they aren't part of Preact's core.
    - _**PropTypes are fully supported** in [preact-compat], or you can use them manually._
- [Children]: Not necessary in Preact, because `props.children` is _always an Array_.
    - _`React.Children` is fully supported in [preact-compat]._
- Synthetic Events: Preact's browser support target does not require this extra overhead.
    - _Preact uses the browser's native `addEventListener` for event handling. See [GlobalEventHandlers] for a full list of DOM event handlers._
    - _A full events implementation would mean more maintenance and performance concerns, and a larger API._


## What's Different?

Preact and React have some more subtle differences:

- `render()` accepts a third argument, which is the root node to _replace_, otherwise it appends. This may change slightly in a future version, perhaps auto-detecting that a replacement render is appropriate by inspecting the root node.
- Components do not implement `contextTypes` or `childContextTypes`. Children receive all `context` entries drawn from `getChildContext()`.
