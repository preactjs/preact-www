Have you ever wondered what Preact is all about, or how it works?

Maybe you've been creating awesome websites using Wordpress, designing
graphics with D3, or building helpful interactive forms with jQuery.
At some point, the JavaScript you've written became complex enough that
it was difficult to manage - remembering which file controls part of a
page, or debugging an interaction between two plugins trying to enhance
the same element.

Perhaps you've come across Preact at some point, and wondered what's so
special about it? Why do high-traffic sites like IKEA, Bing, Etsy and
[others] use Preact?

The simplest answer is that Preact provides an effective architecture for
building web applications in a uniquely small package. In just 3kb of
JavaScript code ([1 page of text](https://unpkg.com/preact)),
Preact provides the tools needed to construct complex applications by
creating and assembling smaller reusable pieces.

If that sounds compelling to you, this tutorial is a great place to start.
You'll learn not only how to build applications using Preact, but also how
Preact works under the hood. Each chapter contains an opportunity to test
what you've learned, or use the _Help_ button to see the answer.
