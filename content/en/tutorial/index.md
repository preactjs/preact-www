Have you ever wondered what Preact is all about, or how it works?

Perhaps you've been building awesome websites using Wordpress, creating
slick graphics with D3, or adding helpful interactivity to forms with jQuery.
At some point, the JavaScript you write became complex enough that it
was difficult to manage - remembering which file controls a certain
part of a page, or debugging a problematic interaction between two plugins
that both try to enhance the same element.

Maybe you've come across Preact at some point, and wondered what's so
special about it? Why do high-traffic sites like IKEA, Bing, Etsy and
[others] use Preact?

The simplest answer is that Preact provides an effective architecture for
building web applications in a uniquely small package. In just 3kb of
JavaScript code (around [one page of text](https://unpkg.com/preact)),
Preact provides the tools needed to construct complex applications by
assembling smaller reusable pieces. Preact's Virtual DOM lets you focus on
writing application logic, while allowing extensive control over how your
application is set up and rendered to the screen.

If that sounds compelling to you, this tutorial is a great place to start.
You'll learn not only how to build applications using Preact, but also how
Preact works under the hood. Each chapter contains an opportunity to try
what you've learned, or use the _Help_ button to see the answer.
