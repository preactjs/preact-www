# Lifecycle Methods

> _**Tip:** If you've used HTML5 Custom Elements, this is similar to the `attachedCallback` and `detachedCallback` lifecycle methods._

Preact invokes the following lifecycle methods if they are defined for a Component:

| Lifecycle method            | When it gets called                              |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `componentWillMount`        | before the component gets mounted to the DOM     |
| `componentDidMount`         | after the component gets mounted to the DOM      |
| `componentWillUnmount`      | prior to removal from the DOM                    |
| `componentDidUnmount`       | after removal from the DOM                       |
| `componentWillReceiveProps` | before new props get accepted                    |
| `shouldComponentUpdate`     | before `render()`. Return `false` to skip render |
| `componentWillUpdate`       | before `render()`                                |
| `componentDidUpdate`        | after `render()`                                 |
