## Derleme araçları rotası yok

Preact, doğrudan tarayıcıda kullanılmak üzere paketlenmiştir.Herhangi bir derleme veya araç gerektirmez:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { h, Component, render } from 'https://unpkg.com/preact?module';

  // Uygulamınızı oluşturun
  const app = h('h1', null, 'Hello World!');

  render(app, document.body);
</script>
```

[🔨 Glitch'te düzenle](https://glitch.com/~preact-no-build-tools)

Bu şekilde geliştirmenin birincil dezavantajı, bir derleme adımı gerektiren JSX'in olmamasıdır. JSX'e ergonomik ve performanslı bir alternatif bir sonraki bölümde belgelenmiştir.

### JSX'e alternatifler

`h` veya `createElement` çağrıları yazmak sıkıcı olabilir. JSX, HTML'ye benzer görünme avantajına sahiptir, bu da bizim deneyimlerimize göre birçok geliştirici için anlamayı kolaylaştırır. JSX bir derleme adımı gerektirir, bu nedenle [HTM][htm].

[HTM][htm] is a JSX-like syntax that works in standard JavaScript. Instead of requiring a build step, it uses JavaScript's own [Tagged Templates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates) syntax, which was added in 2015 and is supported in [all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=template-literals). This is an increasingly popular way to write Preact apps, since there are fewer moving parts to understand than a traditional front-end build tooling setup.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { h, Component, render } from 'https://unpkg.com/preact?module';
  import htm from 'https://unpkg.com/htm?module';

  // Initialize htm with Preact
  const html = htm.bind(h);

  function App (props) {
    return html`<h1>Hello ${props.name}!</h1>`;
  }

  render(html`<${App} name="World" />`, document.body);
</script>
```

> **Tip:** HTM also provides a convenient single-import Preact version:

> `import { html, render } from 'https://unpkg.com/htm/preact/index.mjs?module'`

## Preact CLI tarafından desteklenen en iyi uygulamalar

[Preact CLI], modern web geliştirme için optimize edilmiş Preact uygulamaları oluşturmaya yönelik kullanıma hazır bir çözümdür. Webpack, Babel ve PostCSS gibi standart takım projeleri üzerine inşa edilmiştir. Preact CLI, başlamak için herhangi bir yapılandırma veya ön bilgi gerektirmez ve bu basitlik, Preact'i kullanmanın en popüler yolu olmasını sağlar.

As the name implies, Preact CLI is a **c**ommand-**l**ine **i**nterface that can be run in the terminal on your machine. Using it, you can create a new application by running the `create` command:

```bash
npx preact-cli create default my-project
```

This will create a new application based on our [default template](https://github.com/preactjs-templates/default). You will be asked for some information about your project, which will then be generated in the directory you specified (`my-project` in this case).

> **Tip:** Any GitHub repository with a `template/` folder can be used as a custom template:
>
> `npx preact-cli create <username>/<repository> <project-name>`

### Getting ready for development

Now we're ready to start our application. To start a development server, run the following command inside your newly generated project folder (`my-project` from above):

```bash
# Go into the generated project folder
cd my-project

# Start a development server
npm run dev
```

Once the server has started, it will print a local development URL to open in your browser.
Now you're ready to start coding your app!

### Making a production build

There comes a time when you need to deploy your app somewhere. The CLI ships with a handy `build` command which will generate a highly-optimized production build.

```bash
npm run build
```

Upon completion, you'll have a new `build/` folder which can be deployed directly to a server.

> For a full list of all available commands, check out the [Preact CLI Documentation](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli#cli-options).

## Integrating Into An Existing Pipeline

If you already have an existing tooling pipeline set up, it's very likely that this includes a bundler. The most popular choices are [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [rollup](https://rollupjs.org) or [parcel](https://parceljs.org/). Preact works out of the box with all of them. No changes needed!

### Setting up JSX

To transpile JSX, you need a Babel plugin that converts it to valid JavaScript code. The one we all use is [@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). Once installed, you need to specify the function for JSX that should be used:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx", {
      "pragma": "h",
      "pragmaFrag": "Fragment",
    }]
  ]
}
```

> [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) has some of the best documentation out there. We highly recommend checking it out for questions surrounding Babel and how to set it up.

### Aliasing React to Preact

At some point, you'll probably want to make use of the vast React ecosystem. Libraries and Components originally written for React work seamlessly with our compatibility layer. To make use of it, we need to point all `react` and `react-dom` imports to Preact. This step is called _aliasing._

> **Note:** If you're using [Preact CLI], these aliases are automatically handled for you by default.

#### Aliasing in webpack

To alias any package in webpack, you need to add the `resolve.alias` section
to your config. Depending on the configuration you're using, this section may
already be present, but missing the aliases for Preact.

```js
const config = { 
   //...snip
  "resolve": { 
    "alias": { 
      "react": "preact/compat",
      "react-dom/test-utils": "preact/test-utils",
      "react-dom": "preact/compat",     // Must be below test-utils
      "react/jsx-runtime": "preact/jsx-runtime"
    },
  }
}
```

#### Aliasing in Node

When we are on a Node.JS server our webpack aliases won't work, this is seen in Next/...
here we will have to use an alias in our `package.json`.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "npm:@preact/compat",
    "react-dom": "npm:@preact/compat",
  }
}
```

Now Node will correctly use Preact in place of React.

#### Aliasing in Parcel

Parcel uses the standard `package.json` file to read configuration options under
an `alias` key.

```json
{
  "alias": {
    "react": "preact/compat",
    "react-dom/test-utils": "preact/test-utils",
    "react-dom": "preact/compat",
    "react/jsx-runtime": "preact/jsx-runtime"
  },
}
```

#### Aliasing in Rollup

To alias within Rollup, you'll need to install [@rollup/plugin-alias](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/alias).
The plugin will need to be placed before your [@rollup/plugin-node-resolve](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/node-resolve)

```js
import alias from '@rollup/plugin-alias';

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    alias({
      entries: [
        { find: 'react', replacement: 'preact/compat' },
        { find: 'react-dom/test-utils', replacement: 'preact/test-utils' },
        { find: 'react-dom', replacement: 'preact/compat' },
        { find: 'react/jsx-runtime', replacement: 'preact/jsx-runtime' }
      ]
    })
  ]
};
```

#### Aliasing in Jest

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) allows the rewriting of module paths similar to bundlers.
These rewrites are configured using regular expressions in your Jest configuration:

```json
{
  "moduleNameMapper": {
    "^react$": "preact/compat",
    "^react-dom/test-utils$": "preact/test-utils",
    "^react-dom$": "preact/compat",
    "^react/jsx-runtime$": "preact/jsx-runtime"
  }
}
```

#### Aliasing in Snowpack

To alias in [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), you'll need to add a package import alias to the `snowpack.config.mjs` file.

```js
// snowpack.config.mjs
export default {
  alias: {
    "react": "preact/compat",
    "react-dom/test-utils": "preact/test-utils",
    "react-dom": "preact/compat",
    "react/jsx-runtime": "preact/jsx-runtime",
  }
}
```

## TypeScript preact/compat configuration

Your project could need support for the wider React ecosystem.  To make your application
compile, you might need to disable type checking on your `node_modules` and add paths to the types
like this.  This way, your alias will work properly when libraries import React.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "react": ["./node_modules/preact/compat/"],
      "react-dom": ["./node_modules/preact/compat/"]
    }
  }
}
```
