# Preact CLI

[Preact CLI](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli/) helps you get started building a blazing-fast Preact PWA in just a few seconds.

Preact CLI takes the pain out of starting a new project, getting you up and running instantly with a minimal and understandable project structure. It's powered by the same Open Source tools you know and love, just without the need to configure anything - Webpack, Babel, Terser, etc. Everything from hot-reloading to critical CSS inlining is set up optimally for you. 

Preact CLI puts your project on the path to excellent performance. New projects ship just 4.5kB of JavaScript in production and get interactive in under 3s - even on slow devices and networks.
