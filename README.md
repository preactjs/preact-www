# Application Structure

This website is built as a [prerendered static app](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web#static-rendering), following the [Application Shell pattern](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell).

#### Content

Content is fetched and rendered on the fly from Markdown documents located in `content/`, similar to how Jekyll works.
Documents can contain optional YAML FrontMatter for specifying page metadata or layout information.
Once fetched, content is parsed using [marked] and rendered to VDOM via [preact-markup].

#### Custom Elements

Since [preact] is used to render the Markdown content, HTML contained in a document reference any of the Components listed in `src/components/widget.js` as Custom Elements, useful for dynamic content:

```md
## Example Page

<!-- Jumbotron and Logo are actually Preact components! -->
<jumbotron>
    <h1><logo text>Preact</logo></h1>
</jumbotron>
```

#### Navigation

Currently, the navigation menu and route handling is controlled by `src/config.json`.
This is likely to change, but in the meantime it means any new pages must be linked from the `"nav"` section of the config.
